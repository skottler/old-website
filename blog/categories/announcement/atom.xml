    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>July 23rd is my first day at <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>. I am lucky enough to be building the open source Puppet, Foreman, and Katello projects as the primary function of my work.</p>

<p>My time at Venmo has been incredible. The team is fantastic; some of the smartest and most driven people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Red Hat will allow me to take the knowledge that I've gained over the past few years around how multi-stage production environments are managed and build products and projects to help streamline those processes.</p>

<p>Red Hat is an incredible place. Open source is deep in their roots (obviously) and they have a proven track record of transparency, innovation, and contribution. Their genuine desire to make the world a better place through free open source software aligns well with my views. It will be a wonderful place for me to grow and get a variety of different opportunities; I see myself being there for a long time.</p>

<p>I will be working remotely from <a href="wheatoncollege.edu">school</a> in
Massachusetts.</p>
